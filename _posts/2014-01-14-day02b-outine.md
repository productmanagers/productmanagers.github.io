###Goal###
To share an idea of where we are heading with a top-level view of future contents.

###Outline of Posts###
_I want to divide the content into roughly four parts, each with related set of ideas and exercises._

* __Part 1__ - Development environment and tools set-up and tinkering
* __Part 2__ - Software product development process (primarily non-technical discussion); I will invite guest bloggers when possible
* __Part 3__ - Blogging and buliding with Jekyll and Bootstrap (gets technical)
* __Part 4__ - Growth hacking (start-upy topic)

And that\'s essentially it. I hope these will give you a familiarity with tools, concepts, and processes used by more technical folks to build modern day businesses. What they won\'t do is to teach you a foundation in programming. But, building a website and being able to push content to the web is a good first start for you to gain familiarity and comfort. More importantly, it may enlighten you as to other threads to take a deeper dive, whether it is:

* Continue to build on the personal-site to add functionality (using Ruby and JavaScript)
* Beginning to start programming seriously, starting with online resources like [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/)
* Look into attending a [full-time coding bootcamp](http://leanpub.com/coding-bootcamps)
* Or look deeper into product management or one of the functional specialties, like [data science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science).

The point is, this is just the start.
