###Goal###
Try a hand at prototyping by using mock-up tools.

_The only way to succeed is to fail. Therefore, fail early and often. - Michael Hunter_

###Recap###
So the previous exercise was a video tutorial of [using git to push code](../git-push-pull-supplement).

By the way, you\'re probably familiar with the aphorism - _fail early, fail often_. I had evn heard it from a guest speaker while attending Darden. See Michael Hunter\'s [original blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/micahel/archive/2005/08/17/failfast.aspx) where I think the phrase comes from.

###Main Course###
__Mockups__

Right. So let\'s dive right in. Whenever my friends talk about prototyping, they always seem to bring up [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/), so I guess we should start there. For a taste, you don\'t' even have to download Balsamiq - we can just play around directly in the browser and get a feel.

The diagram in [HTML basics lesson](../html-add-text-images) I shared other day was done with Balsamiq. It\'s a nice tool for quick visuals like that one - reproduced below. The nice thing is, after you create your mock-up, you can export it to an image, or save the Balsamiq work file for future edit, and so forth.

[Google Drive Drawings](http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html) is also surprisingly useful. It is easy to use and easy to share thanks to its integration to the Drive. You could use it to design your simple blog site, and post a link to show others. I was playing around the other day, and came up with this in a minute or two.

Fancy, eh?

Interestingly, for me the __biggest takeaway__ is not even the prototyping tools themselves, but rather the attention that the Balsamiq and Google teams pay to usability. For one, both tools are focused for the intended task. Next, the quantity of features is well balanced - not too much so as to confuse (a common complaint with Photoshop), and not too few so as to remain powerful.

You can also tell the user segment that they target are lite-usage users.

* Industrial users would want more features, while
* Super-users might like open-source that they can customize directly (e.g. GIMP vs. Photoshop)

__Other Tools__

There are many other tools. Some startup teams use [Axure](http://www.axure.com/) - it is an industrial-strength prototyping tool with free 30-day trial. Other teams separate the UI design and actual coding. A popular UI tool is the expensive, ubiquitous, and possibly useless [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/). By the way, the aforementioned [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) is free Photoshop clone built by the open-source community. We will talk about the open-source community again in future.

###Summary###
None

###Resources###
So, we looked at [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/) and [Google Drive Drawings](http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html) in this lesson. And there is a rich suite of free-ish products for you to use and design web products. To my knowledge, the best such resource is:

* [Hack Design toolkit](https://hackdesign.org/toolkit/rapid-prototyping) - wealth of tools curated by top designers

###Funwork###
Okay, the prior statement _'possibly useless'_ in referring to Photoshop is unfair. My mission is to equip you with the awareness of useful tools to be more effective as a product manager. This was not a debate over best prototyping tools, or whether or not you should use them. Now, you know they exist, do some good in the world with that knowledge!

That said, in this __Funwork__ section, I confess I rarely use a prototyping tool. I did when I was a newbie, but I found I enjoy the code-view-debug cycle more to my taste. Plus prototyping has this danger: I felt like I was doing something, __but I was not building the actual product!__ For example, for high-level ideas, pencil sketch or Google Drawing works fine. To create high fidelity mock-ups with something lik Axure and Photoshop is time-consuming. In large organizations, it could be a full-time job unto itself (a UI designer, for example). And yet I could not really see the point of handing off something that is just a fancy image to a development team to build. (This is possibly why Balsamiq is successful - it is well-balanced.)

It is very difficult to appreciate and design the complexities of a product _a priori_ using a drawing. _This is only my opinion._ Yet, I have corroborated my own impressions with a team that I really respect. I found this insightful blog by the folks at [37 Signals](http://37signals.com/).

* [Why 37 Signals Skips Photoshop](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop) - it is a worthwhile counter-point. I will add that this is a very _engineering-centric_ view, but the point about streamlining is a valuable one for the manager to embrace.

###Meditation###
* Is success gained only through failure, as Michael\'s quote suggests?

* _Is David full of shit about prototyping being a waste of time?_
