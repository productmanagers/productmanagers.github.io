###Goal###
Get comfortable with [__HTML__](http://www.w3.org/html/), and learn how to add text, images, and links.

###Recap###
So the previous exercise was about [setting up github](../setting-up-github/) and other aspects of your coding environment. I hope it all worked. If you struggled, the supplement to this lesson will be a walkthrough of [git push supplement](../git-push-pull-supplement/). So not to worry! Never worry! Instead ask questions. You\'ll never learn if you are afraid of asking questions - even dumb questions. I found the software community to be some of the most open-minded and giving professionals around.

###Main Course###
If you clicked on the [__HTML__](http://www.w3.org/html/) link above, you\'ll have seen that HTML is "the publishing language of the World Wide Web." You might also notice that the [w3.org](http://www.w3.org/) is the standard-setting body for this (and many other) web standard.

__A. Browser is a HTML parser__

A _parser_ is like an interpreter. As an example, you feed it French, and it gives back English so you can understand it.

For our purposes, it\'s probably enough to share the following diagram of how what you do relates to the web. On the left, you type html, then in the middle, web or mobile browser _parses_ the html with built-in parsers. This allows the browsers to _render_ the html (or css or other markup instructions) to the end-users on the right. For us, the end-users could be mom and dad, or your friends, or me, or potential recruiters.

__B. Clone your github repo to local__

If you did the previous lesson on [generating a page with git](../first-site-with-git-generator) correctly, you have a __github repo__ (short for repository) named `user_name.github.io`. Clone this repo to your computer by doing this:

* First navigate to a folder location where you want to clone your repo.
* Next copy the repo url from github. If you need help with this and next step, check out [git push-pull supplement](../git-push-pull-supplement/).
* In your terminal navigated to the correct folder where you want to clone your repo.
* Clone with the following command (The $ sign comes with your terminal, so don\'t type that):

  `$ git clone [paste_your_repo_address_here]`

* When you hit enter, you will see some messages in your console, and then you will find that it will have created a clone of the files you see on your github on your computer, so that you can edit and play with the files.

__C. Folder structure__

Now, whatever you might have generated by way of first page, I would like us to sync our folder structure as follows:

    .
    |-- _config.yml
    |-- _includes
    |-- _layouts
    |   |-- default.html
    |   |-- post.html
    |-- _posts
    |   |-- 2011-10-25-open-source-is-good.markdown
    |   |-- 2011-04-26-hello-world.markdown
    |-- _site
    |-- index.html
    |-- assets
        |-- css
            |-- style.css
        |-- javascripts

###Summary###
So, in this exercise, you have begun to harness the power of HTML. If you think about it, that really is the gateway to __all web and mobile__ experiences! Pretty cool, huh?

###Resources###
Was it tough to follow some of this stuff? Please share your gripes in the comments. Also, keep in mind, I\'m going to make a [git push supplement](../git-push-pull-supplement/) to this exercise for more practice. Stay tuned.

###Funwork###
Notice that we are using a combination of [__sublime text editor__](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and __console__ to do our development. This is fairly typical of many developers. However, as you meet more developers, you will learn that some swear by Emacs or Vim. In fact, you could say that [Emacs vs Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war) is one of those culture wars in tech - so much so that there is even a wikipedia entry on it.

The gist of it is that in Emacs or Vim, you don\'t need to switch between lines of code (in text editor) and running the code (in console). In other words, you can live in code-nirvana where you do everything in one screen. Why is this a big deal? Because 1) it can save precious seconds of switching between the tools and 2) it allows the developer to focus more by working with everything in one view.

__MBA Tip__: As a business manager, rather than discounting such quirky behavior, be curious about why this matters. You know that culture matters, and text editor is a key culture cue.

* If you are using Linux, Emacs probably comes pre-installed. Try typing `$ emacs` in your console (don\'t type the $ sign - it\'s already there) and check out how it feels to write in it. Kinda challenging for first-timers.
