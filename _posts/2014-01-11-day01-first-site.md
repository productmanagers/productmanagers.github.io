###Goal###
To show your pants off to the world. (Sorry for the apparel reference - it\'s a joke about the proverbial first website tutorial, which is always \"helloworld.\" Though there is a good reason for it - websites become interface to the entire connected world.)

###Recap###
So the point of [initial simple site](../day00-hold-onto-your-pants-site/) lesson on day 0 was to get something up and running on the web.

_Let\'s get you to do the same. To minimize confusion, I suggest we all use same tools when possible._

###Action items###
1. I use Google Chrome browser. I suggest you use Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Long story short, these browsers are easier for web development. Some of the stuff I\'m sharing may not work on Safari or Microsoft Explorer.
2. Sign-up for a [github](https://github.com/join) account. You will learn more about the __git__ system going forward.
3. Make a note of `your_user_name`. For example, mine is `dklounge`. Your github account will be accessible to others at `github.com/your_user_name`.
4. Create a [new repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository) and name it specifically `your_github_user_name.github.io`. For example, I created `dklounge.github.io` under my account.
5. Now, go to the settings of this new repository, and create a web page with [auto page generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator).
6. Once you are on preview step, you will see that you can also edit the page. You can feel your way through the content -> and preview -> edit -> preview -> basically make your first web page using this tool.
7. Once you are ready, click __publish__ and see your handiwork!
8. Don\'t worry about the code stuff you see in the instructions yet. We will get to that tomorrow. All that code in the dark background though, is called command-line. Part of today\'s _funwork_ is to read about it so that it would seem more familiar next time.
9. If you got stuck, or can\'t create the site, feel free to post on my FB wall under the lesson so that others can see what you are dealing with. (Or email me privately if you must.)

###Summary###
What you just did is to create a website.

* Optional - If you are using Windows, ideally you\'ll consider installing Linux. My examples are all going to be in my Ubuntu. This probably doesn\'t mean anything to you now, but I\'ll write about it in future. Why it matters to me (may not matter to you).
* Funwork - These are optional, but you know what they say. You reap what you sow. Learn to enjoy learning.

###Resources###
* Walkthrough of how to [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* SF [RailsBridge Installfest](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/) has a kick-ass walkthrough of how to configure git and SSH key as well. If you feel adventurous, you can try other things - like heroku setup - but no need at this point.

###Funwork###
* Skim through what a [command line interface (cli)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) is. At least admire the pretty pictures. While at it, ruminate on the wonder that is Wikipedia. I grew up at a time when we still had massively heavy paper encyclopedias.

###Meditation###
How do you feel about what you did in this lesson? What are some issues with how we created the website today? Did you learn how to build a website?
