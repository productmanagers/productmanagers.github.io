###Learning Blogs
This repo contains blogs for intro to web. It is a __Web 101 for MBAs__ type of course I wish I had as student. Unfortunately, good developers were too busy (or made too much money) to help me learn to program. But, I like being a guide, and I wanted to help classmates who expressed frustrations about lack of technical background.

The set of lessons will not make the reader a programmer. But, for some, I hope these lessons will open a a window into software engineering, web development, and modern product management. Hence, this guide is to be a guide to the beginning, not the end.

###Refactoring
Beyond the web for mba blogs, we want to start a blog about __refactoring__ `code`. It comes from personal experience and struggles with learning about spec writing, and refactoring code. Over time, I hope I get better. I also hope it becomes a forum where other developers can share their refactoring stories, lessons, or examples. To that end, we would love it if you wanted to contribute content or features to this site.

###Support
I am not being paid to develop this content. If you find this material useful, or simply support the promotion of technical education, please consider [supporting my efforts through gittip](https://www.gittip.com/dklounge/). Thank you so much for your support!
