<p>Hold onto your pants/skirts ... </p>
<p>I am going to share stuff here that I wish someone had shared with me when I started coding. <strong>It is the Web 101 class I wish I had as a MBA student.</strong> Unfortunatley, good developers (<em>I am not one</em>) were/are too busy to help. But, I like being a guide, and I want to help you. <strong>For free!</strong></p>
<p>I know that this page is very Web 1.0. <em>It's because I'm old.</em> We are going to improve this site day by day together. Just follow along by following the daily links. Sometimes, you will only see the usefulness of certain topics looking back. Be patient.</p>
