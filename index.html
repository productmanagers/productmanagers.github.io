<h2>Tech Product Manager</h2>

<p>I want to share stuff that I wish I knew when I started coding. <strong>It is the Web 101 and Technology Survey course I wish I had</strong> as a MBA student.</p>

<p>Good developers were too busy (or made too much money) to help me. Fortunately, I like being a guide, and I want to <strong>help save you time and pain. All For free!</strong></p>

<p>Follow along each new lesson to build your personal blog or personal portfolio page. Sometimes, the value of the topic will become apparent only in looking back. Be patient.</p>

<h4>Progress Note</h4>
Before we learn more about product management, we are getting our technical toes wet with HTML/CSS (Bootstrap). If you have been following, you should have a github repo similar <a target="_" href="https://github.com/productmanagers/personal_page_demo">this sample repo</a> (which you can fork and use).
