<p><em>Hold onto your pants/skirts ... </em></p>
<p>I want to share stuff that I wish someone had told me when I started coding. <strong>It is the Web 101 class I wish I had as a MBA student.</strong> Unfortunately, good developers were too busy (or made too much money) to help me. But, I like being a guide, and I want to help you. <strong>For free!</strong></p>
<p>I know that this page is very Web 1.0. <em>It's because I'm old.</em> Actually, we will improve it together over time. Just follow along each new lesson. Sometimes, the value of the topic will become apparent only in looking back. Be patient.</p>
