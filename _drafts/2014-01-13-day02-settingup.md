###Goal###
To get your machine ready to roll.

###Recap###
So [day 1](../day01-creating-your-first-website/) wasn\'t too bad. Github made it so easy for us. But, trust me,

_Let\'s keep things simple by using the same set-up as much as possible._

###Funwork###
* CodeSchool has a nice [Try Git](http://try.github.io/) program.

Are you having fun?
