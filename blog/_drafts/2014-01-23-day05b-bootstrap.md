###Summary###
None

###Resources###
* Download [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).
* If you still get stuck, please feel free to reach out with question via [contact form](../../ask/).

###Funwork###
* We are going to soon install and use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html) to build static sites. You might enjoy glancing ahead.
* To take advantage of __Jekyll__ we will need to learn Markdown. (Note that HTML is a markup language. Such humor and word play is quite prevalent in the software development space.) Checkout the [syntax for markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). But, don\'t get bogged down. We will learn markdown as we go forward.

###Meditation###
