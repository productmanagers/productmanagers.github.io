I recently read a post on the craft of product management titled [So you want to manage a product?](http://medium.com/on-product-management/c664ba7e5138) by [Rohini Vibha](https://medium.com/@rohinivibha), PM at Livefyre. It is a great post that handles numerous themes, and there is a section about four main things product managers do:

> 1. You are not managing a product. You are managing the problem it solves.
>
> 2. Your product is only as good as a user\’s perception of it.
>
> 3. Product Managers are neither designers nor engineers.
>
> 4. It\’s not about being a star — It\’s about managing a universe.
