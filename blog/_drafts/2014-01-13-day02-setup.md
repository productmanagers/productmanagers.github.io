###Goal###
To get your machine ready to roll with the right tools.

_Wax on, wax off, Daniel San. - Mr. Miyagi_

###Recap###
So the previous exercise was [about using git generator to make a web page](../first-site-with-git-generator/). Github made it so easy for us. But, how much understanding do you have of what you did?

_There\'s a difference between having a steak served to you and cooking it yourself. When you cook it yourself, you understand what makes a good steak, what conditions are required, how you get a certain flavor. Usually, you learn it after a few bad ones._

###Action Items###
To cook, you should be in a kitchen with some basic cooking utensils. We are going to get the basic environment up for software engineering. This is actully a big topic (so it may come up again in future). In general, I\'ll stick to the bare minimum to keep things simple.

You might get stuck. It can be painful. Be calm and patient. Starting this lesson, I\'m adding disqus comments so you can ask for help directly on this page. Again, feel free to ask via Facebook, or email me with questions.

Others have already documented set-up howoto, so I\'ll just point you to the source. Google is your friend. Good luck!

First try these and see whether you already have the proper set-up. For example, in your command-line (aka terminal, aka console), you type `git --version` and you should get some response back.

Here\'s the basic toolkit:
1. (x) Chrome browser to see your work (you got this in the last lesson)
2. ( ) Text editor to write your code (see below)
3. ( ) Ruby to run your code (see below)
4. ( ) Github set-up that you signed-up for in the prior lesson (see below)
5. ( ) Command-line (that you read about in the previous lesson)

* Chrome, check! (Firefox is okay, too.)
* On the whole, SF [RailsBridge Installfest](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/) has a kick-ass walkthrough of how to configure git, download a text-editor and set-up SSH key. If you can successfully follow this, you are pretty much set. (You don\'t need to do Heroku set-up yet - to avoid confusion.)
* If things did not work, you may follow [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) link by the github folks.
* As for text editor, I use sublime - for Mac people, [RailsBridge](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/) uses Textmate, but you can still download and use [Sublime 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). It is free to use with indefinite trial period - so you don\'t have to pay license for now. This is a fairly-common business model in tech. Free trial and pay if you like it. Or never pay.
* For Windows people, you have [windows installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) but set-up might be a bit tricky, because you also need to install the __development kit__. It should be straight-forward, but ask me if I can help. I was able to install on my old Lenovo laptop (from Darden) no problem!
* If you feel adventurous, you can try other things - like heroku setup - but no need for what we will do.
* Zed Shaw wrote a whole thing on [command-line set-up](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex1.html) and how to for Linux/Mac/Windows.

###Summary###
Sorry, it\'s a lot, but you are used to the drinking from firehose experience, so give it your best.

If all went well, you should be able to check your versions in your command line as in the image above.

###Resources###
* If you get weird machine complaints during install, copy and paste the error in [google.com](http://www.google.com). Seriously, google is your friend.
* Checkout the course outline in the [companion lesson](../web101-for-mba-outline/)

###Funwork###
* Play with git. CodeSchool has a nice [Try Git](http://try.github.io/) lesson.

###Meditation###
Are you having fun? If so, why? If not, what is bothering you?
