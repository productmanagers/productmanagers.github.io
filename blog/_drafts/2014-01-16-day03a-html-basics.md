###Goal###
Get comfortable with [__HTML__](http://www.w3.org/html/), and learn how to add text, images, and links.

###Recap###
So the previous exercise was about [setting up github](../setting-up-github/) and other aspects of your coding environment. I hope it all worked. If you struggled, the supplement to this lesson will be a walkthrough of [git push supplement](../git-push-pull-supplement/). So not to worry! Never worry! Instead ask questions. You\'ll never learn if you are afraid of asking questions - even dumb questions. I found the software community to be some of the most open-minded and giving professionals around.

###Main Course###
If you clicked on the [__HTML__](http://www.w3.org/html/) link above, you\'ll have seen that HTML is "the publishing language of the World Wide Web." You might also notice that the [w3.org](http://www.w3.org/) is the standard-setting body for this (and many other) web standard.

__A. Browser is a HTML parser__

A _parser_ is like an interpreter. As an example, you feed it French, and it gives back English so you can understand it.

For our purposes, it\'s probably enough to share the following diagram of how what you do relates to the web. On the left, you type html, then in the middle, web or mobile browser _parses_ the html with built-in parsers. This allows the browsers to _render_ the html (or css or other markup instructions) to the end-users on the right. For us, the end-users could be mom and dad, or your friends, or me, or potential recruiters.

__B. Clone your github repo to local__

If you did the previous lesson on [generating a page with git](../first-site-with-git-generator) correctly, you have a __github repo__ (short for repository) named `user_name.github.io`. Clone this repo to your computer by doing this:

* First navigate to a folder location where you want to clone your repo.
* Next copy the repo url from github. If you need help with this and next step, check out [git push-pull supplement](../git-push-pull-supplement/).
* In your terminal navigated to the correct folder where you want to clone your repo.
* Clone with the following command (The $ sign comes with your terminal, so don\'t type that):

  `$ git clone [paste_your_repo_address_here]`

* When you hit enter, you will see some messages in your console, and then you will find that it will have created a clone of the files you see on your github on your computer, so that you can edit and play with the files.

__C. Folder structure__

Now, whatever you might have generated by way of first page, I would like us to sync our folder structure as follows:

    .
    |-- _posts (this is an empty folder named with underscore first)
    |-- index.html (file with .html extension)
    |-- assets (folder with sub-folders)
        |-- css
            |-- main.css
        |-- images
            |-- profile.png
        |-- javascripts

You\'ll notice the single dot at the top of the directory structure refers to current folder. You probably don\'t have a folder called `_posts` yet, so you can create it. You all know how to make a new folder in our GUI-centric world using mouse. Programmers make and delete folders from their command-line.

__Create a folder__

To make a folder, type: `$ mkdir _posts`, which will create a folder named `_posts` (again don\'t type the dollar sign - it should already be there in your command line).

__Delete a folder__

To delete that folder, you do `rmdir` command. You guessed it. `mkdir` is make directory, while `rmdir` is remove directory. These are old unix commands.

__Create a file__

If you don\'t already have an `index.html` file, it is easy to make one in your console.

`$ touch a_new_file`

The `touch` unix command creates a new file in your current directly. But, uh oh, you forgot to give it the __.html__ extension name. No problem, you can simply use the move command `mv`. For example, with `index`

`$ mv index index.html`

Would "move" the file called _index_ to _index.html_, or essentially rename the file.

__index.html__

Let\'s strip and then put some stuff inside of your html as follows:

{% highlight html linenos %}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Your title</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>Hold onto your pants</p>
      </body>
    </html>
{% endhighlight %}

You can use your browser to navigate to this folder, find the `index.html` file and open it. Then you will see this item displayed! Once again, refer to the diagram at the top of this page. Remember how your browser __renders__ the __html__ you type?

You can try typing other things like _"This is silly"_, and you should see the results of your handiwork!

You can see that in general, the HTML structure has an __opening tag__ `<html>` and a __closing tag__ `</html>`. Closing tag is indicated with that leading slash. The __title__ tag goes inside the `<head>` while `<p>` tag is for paragraph. Inside the opening and closing paragraph tag, you can type any text.

__Adding Image__

Inside of the `./assets/images/` folder (once again, the dot refers to current directory), let\'s drop in some picture - how about your profile picture from twitter or from LinkedIn? Just download it and put it inside that folder and name it something simple like `profile.png` or `.jpg` or whatever the image extension it happens to be when you download it.

Modify the __html__ file between the body tages to add an image. (By the way, the numbers just indicate line numbers in your text editor - it is a reference, not something you type directly.)

{% highlight html %}
    ...
    <body>
      <p>Hold onto your pants</p>
      <p>This is me!</p>
      <img src="./assets/images/profile.png" alt="my handsome face">
    </body>
    ...
{% endhighlight %}
Notice this is a new __img__ tag. Unlike the other tags we saw, this one stands alone and does not have a closing tag. The `src=` is called a tag __attribute__ and in this case, shows the source path to the image you saved in the `assets/images/` folder. If you did your work properly, then you should see your face on this page along with the new text!

The `alt` tag is optional, but in the event a browser cannot render your image, because of slow connection or because images are blocked, this alt text will appear instead.

__Pushing to git__

Good job! You\'ve done a lot, and now you have this nice looking page. Go to your personal page address `http://your_account_name.github.io`. You still see your old content, and not the new index page with your picture and such. It\'s because your awesome page is sitting in your computer folder. To __deploy__ it to the web, you have to __push__ that code.

* First you check the status of the file change using the __git status__ command:

`$ git status`

It should show you what files changed, etc. Now you are ready to add the files. We will just add the whole current folder, which you will recall is a dot.

`$ git add .` (don\'t forget that dot at the end)

Trying typing `git status` again. You\'ll see it is ready to be committed.

`$ git commit -m "my first git push"`

And finally, you are ready to push this code.

`$ git push origin master`

After this, you should see your page online! Yay! If you make other changes to your code, you just repeat the process and push the code to your repo again. Hopefully, this weird language is now becoming more familiar the more you use it.

Ok, that was a lot. Again, we will repeat the git stuff in the supplement, and also remember that there is a CodeSchool lesson called [Try Git](http://try.github.io/).

###Summary###
So, in this exercise, you have begun to harness the power of HTML. If you think about it, that really is the gateway to __all web and mobile__ experiences! Pretty cool, huh?

###Resources###
Was it tough to follow some of this stuff? Please share your gripes in the comments. Also, keep in mind, I\'m going to make a [git push supplement](../git-push-pull-supplement/) to this exercise for more practice. Stay tuned.

###Funwork###
__Unix Commands__

* You created a new folder using `mkdir` above. You were able to remove that same directory with `rmdir` command. What if the folder is not empty. What if there is a file inside that directory you want to remove? Try looking up how to do that.

__Editors__

Notice that we are using a combination of [__sublime text editor__](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and __console__ to do our development. This is fairly typical of many developers. However, as you meet more developers, you will learn that some swear by Emacs or Vim. In fact, you could say that [Emacs vs Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war) is one of those culture wars in tech - so much so that there is even a wikipedia entry on it.

The gist of it is that in Emacs or Vim, you don\'t need to switch between lines of code (in text editor) and running the code (in console). In other words, you can live in code-nirvana where you do everything in one screen. Why is this a big deal? Because 1) it can save precious seconds of switching between the tools and 2) it allows the developer to focus more by working with everything in one view.

__MBA Tip__: As a business manager, rather than discounting such quirky behavior, be curious about why this matters. You know that culture matters, and text editor is a key culture cue.

* If you are using Linux, Emacs probably comes pre-installed. Try typing `$ emacs` in your console (don\'t type the $ sign - it\'s already there) and check out how it feels to write in it. Kinda challenging for first-timers.

_How does it feel to have such an instant feedback loop for creating new content?_
