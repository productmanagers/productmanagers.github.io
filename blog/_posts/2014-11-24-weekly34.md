###PM Reading Digest - Happy Thanksgiving
Your weekly product management reading. _The secret of getting ahead is getting started_.

Well, there is nothing inherently Thanksgiving about the content of this week's digest, but I am grateful to have another chance to connect with you.  I am grateful to have the chance to share events and readings with you.  Before I get too touchy-feely, onto business!

Thanks again to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ryanglasgow">Ryan Glasgow</a>, senior PM at Weebly, who shared a wonderful approach to building new things as a product manager.  The first reading is his slide deck.  (He also gave us a related book reading - see below.)

>"Unfortunately, nearly everyone seems to think they’d make a great PM (engineers, consultants, you name it), but the reality is that most folks just can’t hack it. I’ve worked with countless PMs at huge companies like Yahoo and Google, and over the past two months have interviewed over twenty PM candidates."

_sigh ... you better buck up!_

_I messed up last week's book share, so wanted to repeat the Effective Executive._

But, since that's last week's book, I want to share a new one, one that Ryan recommended.
