###PM Reading Digest - Culture

Your weekly product management reading. _The secret of getting ahead is getting started_.

Hey, how was your weekend?  Hope it was awesome!

Do you know anyone who should get this newsletter?  __Please share with a friend!__

Last week, I mentioned how great founders <a target="_" href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/newsletter/pmfasttrack-2014-10-13/">focus on the product</a>. Nothing else matters.

I chuckle at the irony of me re-writing that.  I often shuffle my focus between projects, including this newsltter.  But, I think the statement _nothing else matters_ can be applied at various scopes - sometimes to one life project, at other times to various projects.

The point is, as with customer focus, product focus is a state of mind.

What do you think?  Have you been obsessing over your product since last week?

Great product. Product obsession. It is a state of mind. It is a matter of culture.  (Read on for more, and about a <a target="_" href="http://www.culturesummit.co/">Culture Summit</a> coming in 2015.)

>"I decided to share because I recently had the opportunity to teach a talented young PM. I was surprised when she said “I’m getting negative feedback at work – can I not cut it as a PM?” Based on my class, yes, she will definitely be a good PM."

_Ellen\'s post reminds me of a recent conversation with a male friend - product manager at a biotech startup - who recently left his role.  Shortly before that, we grabbed dinner, and he confessed to me how he was not sure if he was cut out to be a PM, how he had been getting negative feedback at work ..._

_I am sure being a new PM is not easy for many.  It is very helpful if you can find mentors who can share objective assessments outside of your team, and help share guidance or resources to help you succeed._

_So, apparently the issue is not gender-specific, and you are not alone.  Don\'t be disheartened!_

>"Culture is to employees what branding is to consumers. Every startup has a culture. The type and quality of it varies depending on the extent to which it is designed — that is, the extent to which the founders of a company deliberately choose a set of fundamental values upon which the company will be built, and further, the extent to which they ensure that these values manifest. The right kind of cultures ultimately reach consumers as well."
