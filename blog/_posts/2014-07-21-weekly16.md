###PM Reading Digest - Coming of Age for PMs
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

Last week Lewis Lin spoke to <a target="_" href="http://meetup.com/productmanagementfasttrack">PM Fast Track meetup</a> audience about [Product Manager interviews](../pmfasttrack-2014-07-14).  Friends at <a target="_" href="http://www.carbonfive.com/">Carbon Five</a> hosted us.  Carbon Five develops and designs web and mobile products for their clients.  They are also active in the SF developer community, and hosted <a target="_" href="http://railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> recently.  I volunteered in a front-end class.

####Coming of Age for PMs?

Speaking to one of the Carbon Five principals, <a target="_" href="http://www.carbonfive.com/employee/courtney-hemphill">Courtney Hemphill</a> made me wonder whether Product Management is on a cusp of a big demand shift for the better.  Tech-savy teams start with programmers and designers, and now increasingly are adding product managers.  I call it the __Product Triumvirate__.  Other consultancies like Pivotal Labs seem to be on the same page as judged from job openings of PM roles.

During a [bike ride](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Bike-SF/) with some startup folks, one of the heads of operations for a fin-tech startup mentioned to me that his team is hiring its first product manager (they hired a head of product who will lead that effort and build out the team).  These anecdotes point to me the natural progression of talent needs at a growing tech company.

Increasingly, I am convinced that for a web or mobile tech company to be great, it needs a great PM or needs to be educated about its need for one.

####The Future is Here

Of course, the future is already here.

Product managers have been a key part of Silicon Valley success story for years.

So how do you find a product manager?  If you are founder looking to hire your product team, how do you know a great product manager unless you were one?

__Ben Horowitz__, in his book <a target="out" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DQ845EA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DQ845EA&linkCode=as2&tag=pmft-20&linkId=AMPLKVHKIWC6PV3V">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=pmft-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DQ845EA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> shares some answers to that very question.

It is a must read for founders, and for aspiring product managers.

As for aspiring PMs, <a target="_" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinjulka">Nitin Julka</a> (a PMFT member), shared a post about how he found a PM job.

>After six years of running an Ohio-based IT business, I was ready for a change. _I wanted to work in Product Management_ at a rapidly growing, venture-backed startup in Silicon Valley. I had loved software technology my entire life ... <a target="_" href="https://sites.google.com/site/njulka02/how-i-got-my-first-valley-based-product-management-job-in-5-weeks">read more</a>

See how Nitin did it!
