###PM Reading Digest - Little Things

Your weekly product management reading. _The secret of getting ahead is getting started_.

I hope you all had an awesome Thanksgiving!  I'm visiting my family in North Carolina, and have to admit, it's pretty damn nice to relax around family.  I hope you get to spend plenty of time around those you love.

As for product, I don't have much reading to share.  But, I really liked what Jeff wrote, not only because he talks about how simplistic people can behave, but also because he writes about the opportunity to do more for users.  So, product managers, take a step back, and do something good for your users, and think about how you're doing that.

>"If I have learned anything from the Internet, it is this: be very, very careful when you put a number next to someone's name. Because people will do whatever it takes to make that number go up."

Lately, I've been focusing more on the <a target="_blank" href="http://culturesummit2015.eventbrite.com/?aff=pmft">Culture Summit</a>, and my reading accordingly have had less pure product management focus.  Still, when you think about it, culture is the ultimate ingredient behind great products.  It all comes down to people.

>"We take care of the people, the products and the profits…in that order." - Jim Barksdale, as reported by Ben Horowitz (the guy who also wrote the piece <a target="_blank" href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/e140/e140a/handouts/ProductMgmt.txt">Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager</a>)

>"The brand is just a lagging indicator of the culture." - Tony Hsieh, founder of Zappos
