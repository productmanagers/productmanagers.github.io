###PM Reading Digest
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, no too little, just right_.

It turns out that one of our members runs the <a target="out" href="http://goo.gl/1JzrEM">Lean Startup Machine</a>. Hung is awesome, and he is organizing the next event in SF on May 16-18 and offers product lovers 20% off (use "lsm20"). Last week\'s readings were all about [frameworks]({{BASE_PATH}}/newsletter/pmfasttrack-2014_04-29_frameworks), and my coffee with Hung got me thinking about hackers, and about a conversation I once had with another PM about engineering versus product.

And our [Hackers and PMs](http://www.meetup.com/ProductManagementFastTrack/events/177842522/) event made me wonder:

> If started today, how would the <a target="out" href="http://craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> team hypothetically fare againt a balanced team of product managers and designers creating an engaging product? (Craigslist has 50 million unique monthly visitors - per <a target='out' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigslist">wikipedia</a>; the team is some 40 engineers - __all__ engineers).
>

I thought it would be useful to share different perspectives.

Tosh works on <a target="out" href="https://medium.com/product-love/ee205854a505">Blossom.io</a> and has some amazing ideas about Product Management. His views are measured and nuanced. In this post, he notes his distate for the expression of software eating the world. Instead:

Understand that Graham is not talking about solving problems by throwing code at it. He is speaking about his own experience of having Viaweb acquired by Yahoo, in which great talent is averaged down. He\'s thoughts are eye-opening, so you should read [more](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html).

__Kris Gale__

Kris Gale is VP Engineering at <a target="out" href="https://www.yammer.com">Yammer</a>. This piece seems like something both hackers and product managers can get excited about.

> For years, the two things that most frustrated me to hear from product managers were "how hard would it be..." and "can't you just..." It took me quite a while to figure out why I had such a strong, visceral reaction to these phrases. The answer seems obvious now ... read [more](http://firstround.com/article/the-one-cost-engineers-and-product-managers-dont-consider).

__Hunter Walk and other Big Shots__

Interesting thread of insights and positions by some big names. I will caution the reader to simply keep a healthy dose of skepticism throughout. _The importance and responsibility of a product manager varies quite a bit depending on industry, company, and organization size._

> **Rick Klau**: On a broader note, to answer Hunter's question: yeah, I think we do need PMs. I always loved Todd Jackson's "shit umbrella" theory of product management. Well-functioning product teams *love* having someone act as a buffer. It lets them build without distraction, it lets them achieve consensus on what it is they're building, and it helps them interpret the feedback coming from the users/data/market.
