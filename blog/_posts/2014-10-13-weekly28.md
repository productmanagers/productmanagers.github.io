###PM Reading Digest

Your weekly product management reading. _The secret of getting ahead is getting started_.

Do you know anyone who should get this newsletter?  __Please share with a friend!__

I had the opportunity to attend <a target="_" href="http://www.startupschool.org/">YC Startup School</a> last Saturday with Peter from the <a target="_" href="http://www.startupschool.org/">Startup Digest</a>.  If I had a key insight about building great products from the speakers, it is this:

__Axiom: Be obsessed about your product.  Nothing else matters.__

Which made me wonder.  If you are not a founder-product manager, but rather an employee product manager, just how obsessed can you be about your product?

Jan Koum\'s obsession to building a great product lead to a $19B sale to Facebook!

His obsession meant he never compromised his user experience.  The technical details were immaculate.  He took the long-term view for his product.  He ignored press.  He kept the team small.

There is a corollary to this product obsession.

__Corollary: Be obssessed about your users.  Nothing else matters.__

For most employee product managers, there is probably already a product-market fit.  Which means it all comes down to knowing your users.  Knowing them so well, that you can tell them what they want to hear, while giving them what they really need.

How well do you know your users?

For founder product managers, this is not an issue.  It is not an issue, because they built the product for themselves.  For those of you who didn\'t build your own product, how well do you know your users and their needs?

Would you like to <a target="_" href="https://pmfasttrack.wufoo.com/forms/teaching-via-hangout/">share your exprience</a> with other product managers?

Great PMs can deliver clarity by sensing an opportunity, envisioning the ideal outcome, and then defining the steps needed to get there."
