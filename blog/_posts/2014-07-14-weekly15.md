###PM Reading Digest - A Game
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

Tonight PM Fast Track hosted <a target="_" href="http://www.lewis-lin.com/">Lewis Lin</a> to speak about <a target="_" href="http://www.meetup.com/ProductManagementFastTrack/events/191400832/">How to Get a Job as a Product Manager</a>.  Lewis is the best-selling author of PM interview prep book <a target="_" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IGIUMQ0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00IGIUMQ0&linkCode=as2&tag=pmft-20&linkId=BYCR5YM5LLTAWVS7">Decode and Conquer</a>.

At one point, Lewis asked the audience to pair off and raised this __challenge__:

>_Come up with 20 ways to employ your pet in 2 minutes!_
>

> ![Employ your pet exrecise]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2014-07-14_PMFT_Lin.jpg "Employ your pet" class="img-responsive")
>
> _Lewis Lin leading PMFT meetup_

As you might imagine, pairs came up with all sorts of whacky ideas.  The room filled with noise and laughter; it was hard to generate 20 ideas (_ideas power distribuion - most are expected, few are out there on the long-tail_).

Some complained that the exercise was too broad (_a good PM should know how to build constraints and deadlines_), while others talked about the difficulty of relating to having a pet (_a good product manager must have empathy_).

The exercise was followed by observations on the nature of innovation.

* First, good ideas are difficult to know _a priori_, and therefore an important process to innovation is simply generating many of them.  __Play the numbers game__.

* Second, ideas tend to generate new ideas.  For example, once you generate the idea "Hire my dog to fetch golf balls," it become easy to say "hire my dog to fetch tennis balls," and for that to evolve to "hire my dog as a tennis trainer."

###Homework

There are other gems of wisdom to be derived here, but let me challenge you to perform a similar exercise with your team.  If you are looking for fun ways to break through a roadblock, or to build team rapport, try this or a similar exercise a try.  See what you learn.

_If you buy the hypothesis of (product) innovation as a numbers game, do you have the right systems and metrics in place to deliver results?_
