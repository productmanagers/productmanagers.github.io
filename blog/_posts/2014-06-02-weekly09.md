###PM Reading Digest - Teardown Edition
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

Last Thursday, some of us met in person for a <a target="out" href="http://www.meetup.com/ProductManagementFastTrack/events/182737312/">product teardown workshop</a> comparing [Flickr and Carousel](http://www.slideshare.net/PMFastTrack/product-teardown-workshop-carousel-vs-flickr) mobile apps (<a target="out" href="http://www.slideshare.net/PMFastTrack/product-teardown-air-bnb-hoteltonight">see unannotated slidedeck</a>). As was the case with <a target="out" href="http://www.slideshare.net/PMFastTrack/product-teardown-air-bnb-hoteltonight">Hotel Tonight vs. Airbnb</a>, we broke up into small groups and took a comparative look at these apps along a few key dimensions.

The key goal was to get into the minds of the product teams, to understand the rationale behind the decisions they made. This is an exercise that PMs and product teams __actually do__ regularly. It\'s a great team learning tool. Other benefits of the exercise are:

1. Practice product sense, and sharpen product intuition
2. Stay current on product practices and discover features
3. Learn to articulate product decisions

For a more detailed summary of the analysis dimensions and context for analysis, see our FREE [Product Teardown Guide](http://www.slideshare.net/PMFastTrack/product-teardown-guide).

I wanted to explore these themes further in this week\'s reading. And if you want to learn about these in the context of enterprise products, check out <a target="_" href="http://www.meetup.com/ProductManagementFastTrack/events/182734212/">Mihir\'s upcoming talk</a> at Tradeshift.

>"In my mind, a Product Focused organization is one that has a roadmap and even vision for the product based on delivering something that the team believes will meet market demand – whatever the market may be.  I think of iPad and Apple as a classic example." <a target="_" href="http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/09/product-focused-vs-customer-focused-product-management-what%E2%80%99s-the-difference/">Read more</a>.

Does your product suck? Stop adding new features and “zoom in” instead</a></h4>
__Andrew Chen__

>"The question is, how do you pick the feature you’re going to zoom into? And how do you validate that it can work as a standalone product? And how do you execute the pivot itself and what metrics can you look at?" <a target="_" href="http://andrewchen.co/2013/05/16/does-your-product-suck-stop-adding-new-features-and-zoom-in-instead/">Read more</a>.

###The Fifth Discipline

It occurred to me that the tear down exercise was a collaborative, group learning. In this day and age, this is so important in order to stay relevant and competitive. While that\'s a separate digest topic, I thought I would share a title that may be of interest to the community. If you have read it, please share your [comments on PM Fast Track site](http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/newsletter/pmfasttrack-2014_06-02/).
