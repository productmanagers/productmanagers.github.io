###PM Reading Digest - Frameworks Edition
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

On April 24, about 20 of us met in San Francicso for a hands-on <a target="out" href="http://goo.gl/KvYIvQ">product teardown at Yammer</a>. We analyzed [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) and [Hotel Tonight](http://www.hoteltonight.com/) using general guidelines. The primary goal was to get inside the heads of the PMs who built those apps, and decipher the whys behind their decision to build what they built. You can see the <a target="out" href="http://www.slideshare.net/PMFastTrack/product-teardown-air-bnb-hoteltonight">teardown slides</a> we used (blanks - the session, unfortunately, was not recorded). It was a wonderful learning experience.

A take-away was that to dig deeper, it would be useful to __apply a standard framework__. You\'ll appreciate building on that theme and reading about frameworks this week. Thankfully, others have done the hard work. Enjoy this week\'s reading!

<h4><a target="out" href="http://www.slideshare.net/seanjohnson/framework-thinking-7-frameworks-to-skyrocket-your-career">Framework Thinking - 7 Frameworks</a></h4>
__Sean Johnson__

The full subtitle of this slide deck is "7 Frameworks to Skyrocket Your Career." That said, the deck includes synopsis of frameworks useful to web and mobile product experience, like the <a target="out" href="http://www.behaviormodel.org/">Fogg Behavior Model</a> and the <a target="out" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model">Kano Model</a>. The Kano model is a framework around product development and customer satisfaction.

<h4><a target="out" href="http://www.producttalk.org/2014/01/the-three-pillars-of-building-great-products/">The Three Pillars of Building Great Products</a></h4>
__Teresa Torres__

A few months ago, Teresa asked if "you know what it takes to build great products?" Unlike the feature-level application of frameworks that Sean summarized, Teresa\'s post pertains to those in leadership roles, who must think about the overall progress from a top-level point-of-view, starting with setting a __clear vision__. You can interact with Teresa directly on <a target="out" href="http://goo.gl/r7QTvw">May 6 at wsgr SOMA</a>.

In this post, Chris compares his understanding of value proposition frameworks by Harry Yang and Neil Baron. "Which value prop do you think will feel more compelling to the target customer?" <a target="out" href="http://christophercummings.com/2011/11/11/i-believe-them-because-a-difference-in-value-proposition-frameworks/">Read more</a>.

<h4><a target="out" href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/how-to-manufacture-desire.html">How to Manufacture Desire</a></h4>
__Nir Eyal__

And of course, with our upcoming [book reading meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ProductManagementFastTrack/events/179232312) with the SF UX Book Club, it would be appropriate to introduce Nir\'s Hooked behavior model to those who are unfamiliar with it. Nir walks through how to form desires and habits using trigger, action, reward and investment by the user.

Speaking of the meetup, get the book <a target="out" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJ4A43S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HJ4A43S&linkCode=as2&tag=pmft-20">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</a> and start reading!
