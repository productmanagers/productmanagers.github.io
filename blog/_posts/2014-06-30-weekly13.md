###Trying something different

Your weekly <a target="_" href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/">product management</a> reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

I hate to say it, but I think there are great product reading digests already out there.  For example, the folks at PM Handbook produce a <a target="_" href="http://thepmhandbook.com/">weekly product manager reading digest</a>.  Moreover, there are other product manager blogs, such as <a target="_" href="http://pmblog.quora.com">PM Blog on Quora</a> by Jackie, or similar posts on Medium.

Besides, how much does your product acumen and product management understanding improve from cursory reading of blogs?

So, this week, let\'s experiment.  This week, I want to talk explore a case-study from a content-oriented SaaS business.

If you have experience in this field, I hope you will share insights with me and others, so we can collaborate in discovering answers.

###Case Study - Revenue Prioritization

This is your homework.  Here are the facts of the business (generalized, but based on a real business).

__Industry Background__

A suite of products and businesses are complementing traditional educational institutions.  For example, <a target="_" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a> and similar MOOCs have democratized educational content.  Within the tech-niche, skills-based platforms like <a target="_" href="http://www.skillshare.com/">Skillshare</a> broaden the accessibility of the content to the masses.  Skillshare crowdsources the best teachers on a given topic.  Finally, in-person immersive programs like the <a target="_" href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> condense the traditional educational model to the core skills, and complement them with online resources.

__Business Details__

Let\'s call our business Hacker University.

* Hacker University sells freemium tech educational content
* Premium access gives user access to all content, which includes Ruby, JavaScript, Clojure, and UI/UX Design for $40 per month
* There are 1 million accounts
* There are 50 thousand paying subscribers (or 5% of total accounts)
* Current usage pattern puts average subscription at 6 months, after which users either cancel or suspend accounts
* At this time, there is no easy way to create different pricing points, but it is possible
* The base of paying subscribers find true value in the product.  They learn through it, and some have even found technical jobs as a result of using this product to learn and improve skills.

__Product Management Challenge__

You are hired to help this business grow.

What stands out to you as topics to dig deeper into based on the details shared above?  What do you prioritize?  What would be your top action to increase business success?  What data do you gather to support that hypothesis?

__Related Reading - variable reward__

I came across an intriguing reading in a section of Nir\'s <a target="_" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJ4A43S/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HJ4A43S&linkCode=as2&tag=pmft-20">Hooked</a> book about variable rewards.

>Businesses with finite variability are not inferior _per se_, they just operate under different constraints.  They must constantly churn out new content and experiences to cater to their consumers' insatiable desire for novelty.  It is no coincidence that both Hollywood and the video gaming industry operate under what is called the "studio model," whereby a deep pocketed company provides backing and distribution to a portfolio of movies or games, uncertain which one will become the next mega-hit.
>
>This is in contrast with companies making products exhibiting "infinite variability" - experiences, which maintain user interest by sustaining variability with use.
>
>While content consumption like watching a TV show, is an exapmle of finite variability, content creation is infinitely variabl.  Sites like <a target="_" href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a>, a platform for designers and artists to showcase their work, exemplify the longer-lasting engagement that comes from infinite variability.

__Collaborative__

If any of you are interested in working on this case study together, shoot me a note.  I would be open to setting up an evening Google Hangout and having a short discussion and practice PM thinking with you.

Regardless, next week, I will disclose my thoughts on this problem.
