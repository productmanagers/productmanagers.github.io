###PM Reading Digest - Enterprise Edition
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

Last week, <a href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/">PM Fast Track</a> hosted <a target="_" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mihirnanavati">Mihir Nanavati</a> of <a target="_" href="http://tradeshift.com/">Tradeshift</a>; he spoke to about two dozen people. It was great for those who attended: first it was a fabulous talk about applied lean principles in an enterprise setting, and two, we had some of the highest hosting PMs to attendee ratio ever (which makes for a great networking event for job seekers).

Tradeshift asked us not to share the talk, lest all of their hard work go down the drain, but some of the biggest takeaways for me were thinking about how to bring down the cycle time in Build Measure and Learn lean triad.  And applicable to all product managers, Mihir talked about zealous __focus__, and the challenge of prioritization:

>"How do you __prioritize__, in a way that you __deliver results?__"
>

Those topics also got me thinking about the product management practices shared by other enterprise product leaders, like <a target="_" href="https://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a>, <a target="_" href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>, and <a target="_" href="http://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>.

<h4><a target="out" href="https://medium.com/p/13567fd6a6ed">Build It, Break It, and Repeat: The Yammer Hit List</a></h4>
__Ryan Braastad, Yammer__

This post points to the importance of focus, especially in an enterprise development cycle where the feedback loops may not be as cheap as in consumer-oriented product context.  Mirroring _Lean_ mantra "build, measure, learn," Yammer’s Senior Manager of Enterprise Strategy Ryan Braastad talks about _how_ Yammer remove features in its cycle of build, break, repeat.

Interesting perspective, because it is shared by an enterprise developer now working on a consumer product.  Demis shares some useful side-by-side comparisons. <a target="_" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/enterprise-vs-consumer-development/">Read more</a>.

__Matt Bond, Atlassian__

Granted this is written from the design team perspective, but I thought the march toward a unified vision, and a common conventions that would aid in communicating decisions is pretty awesome.  Does your product team have a product toolkit that borrows from these insights?  Maybe you should check with your design team.

What we hadn’t worked out was how we’d be able to communicate all the decisions we’d made to the wider company for implementation across our product suite."  <a target="_" href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/how-we-made-the-atlassian-design-guidelines-d59a67d6d8eb">Read more</a>.
