###PM Reading Digest
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

In that hands-on spirit, we are hosting another product teardown exercise with team Yammer, this time comparing Flickr and Carousel photo sharing apps - we will post the deck to <a target="out" href="http://www.slideshare.net/PMFastTrack/">Slideshare</a>.
