###PM Reading Digest - Failing Forward and Fast

Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

I have a confession to make.

In the quiet of the night, I sometimes watch something you might not expect me to watch.

Watch this <a target="_" href="http://youtu.be/IChJ6eO3k48">tear jerker of a video</a>.

Don\'t worry.  It\'s Alice Fredenham singing for a Britain\'s Got Talent audition.

She\'s talented.  She\'s mesmerizing.  Was she born with that talent?

###It\'s Easy to Watch, Hard to Try

Why do I share this with you?  Try this one.

A few weeks ago, I lead a small introductory JavaScript class.

I encouraged everyone to follow along on their laptops, but instead everyone just watched me.

I stopped, and told them, learning to program is like __learning by debugging__ (meaning you learn by fixing things that are broken).

I got blank stares.

Last week, I encouraged everyone to improve their produt management game by <a target="_" href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/newsletter/pmfasttrack-2014-08-25/">building things</a>, which builds on our insights gained during <a target="_" href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/newsletter/pmfasttrack-2014-08-18/">project week</a>.

Thinking about these stories made me realize that this advice was not very helpful, because there is a huge inertia to starting.

The root cause of the inertia is __fear__.

Fear of failing.  Fear of imperfection.  Fear of embarrasment.

####Standing on the Shoulders of ...

Thankfully, you don\'t have to be afraid.  Just as I could secretly shed a tear watching Britain\'s Got Talent, you can start using a secret technique.

The technique is simple.

Smart people think of original ideas.  Smarter people borrow (or steal) the idea of smart people.

Then, just add a little bit of your own idea to the base.  Your own little spice to the base.

Seriously.  I was reading an interview of John Clark in <a target="_" href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2012/02/15/ebook/">Balsamiq Interviews</a> (go ahead, it\'s a FREE e-book.  Download it.)  He said something that perfectly illustrates this.

>"I saw something like UserTesting and thought, "That\'s quite good.  It\'s a good idea that delivers a lot of value," but I felt that there were things it didn\'t do. I don'\t like to knock a competitor, but I had my own view of how it could work.  They\'ve prove the market, clearly.  They\'ve been going a few years now.  So rather than taking on a very risky and completely new type of application, I thought ..."

Well, there are a lot of gems there in that short interview passage.  I leave it to you to dig them out and apply them in your life.

####Change Your Attitude
So, there you go.  You have to let go of your fear of starting, and get excited.  And by not having to start from scratch, you get an easy win to start.  From what I\'ve seen, it\'s a big mind shift for many folks.

The technical term for this is <a target="_" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanoia">metanoia</a>, which means a shift of mind.  The non-technical term is something like "think outside the box."  (Please stop saying that.)

And it\'s not just you.  If you\'re a product manager, perhaps you need to instill this new attitude in your team somehow.

I recently read a book that distills and develop some of these ideas more expansively, and I think you\'ll enjoy reading it.  I hope you like it, and other readings shared in our <a target="_" href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/resources/">resources page</a>.
