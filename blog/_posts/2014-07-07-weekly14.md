###PM Fast Track Newsletter
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

In [previous post](../pmfasttrack-2014-06-30), we posed a case about __Hacker University__.  It is based on a real on-line business with a million active users, most of whom are free users with limited access to content.

I had originally planned to continue that case, and dive into the process of focusing on increasing revenues, starting with an analysis of the business as a whole, and then assessing opportunities for doing so through product improvements.

As it happens, the work load associated with responsibilities as a <a target="_" href="https://www.startupdigest.com/">Startup Digest - Silicon Valley Events</a> and other projects has been taxing.  Accordingly, I am unable to continue the case for the time being.  I am very sorry.  I sincerely we can continue in the future.

The team PM Handbook produces a fantastic <a target="_" href="http://thepmhandbook.com/">weekly product manager reading digest</a>.  We are unaffiliated with that team, and yet it is our pleasure to share with you quality items that will help with your education and career!

That said, we continue to work in bringing to you local events - some ours, as well as from others in the community.

If you want to start writing something you know and be featured, let me know.
