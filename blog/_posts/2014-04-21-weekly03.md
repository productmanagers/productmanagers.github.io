###PM Reading List
Each week we bring you product management related reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_. Mirroring the eclectic mix of upcoming [events](http://meetup.com/productmanagementfasttrack), we present a diverse bag from language you use to lead to choice of transparency about development.

<br />

<h4><a target="out" href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2014/04/06/portraying-women-in-product-management/">Portraying Women in Product Management</a></h4>
__Ellen Chisa__

Ellen is PM at Kickstarter. "When we talk about men going into Product Management it’s framed in a completely different light."

<br />
<h4><a target="out" href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/439-four-letter-words">Four letter words</a></h4>
__Jason Fried__

Good product managers and leaders know the importance of communication and the words we choose to convey our message. "When collaborating with others – especially when designers and programmers are part of the mix – watch out for these dirty four letter words."

<br />

__Ryan Hoover__

"Last week I created mockups of an improved comment system for Product Hunt. The design certainly wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t even complete. But I shared them anyway and am glad I did. Within 24 hours I received over 50 annotated pieces of feedback from the community."

<br />

__Yann Girard__

This is playing devil\'s advocate to the prior piece. A good PM knows how to put on a good balancing act!

"That's when I realized that the approach that Lean Startup introduced me to gave me a lot of excuses for actually not pursuing things ambitioned enough, for not being persistent enough and in the end never really getting things done and finally shipping things."
