###Carrying On
Your weekly product management reading. _The secret of getting ahead is getting started_.

<em>Please share this digest with your product friends.</em>

####How to See the Future

Answer: You can\'t!

Damn, tomorrow is hard!

For example, with the Startup Digest, Peter and I measure number of subscribers, and engagement measures like CTR.  But, we also debate whether that matters for the future.  What if we envision a future in which we serve our readers differently?  What if we want an entirely new direction for the product and want a whole NEW set of users.

Driving the roadmap is not all fun. And you risk driving in circles.

_What to do?_

I do not have all the answers.  I know what I am doing about it.  __Break it down to small problems that I can do something about.__

As someone once said: "the most interesting problems are problems you can solve!"

And being as data-driven as possible.  We are collecting data about past usage, and continuing to talk to our customers.

These are doable.  They may not surface answers immediately, but expose you to the threads that lead to an answer (check out Dan Shipper\'s post below).

__What are your product challenges as you look today and tomorrow?__

####So, Tell Me

So, I do this digest for my own reasons.  But, as a human being, I am curious to know what you think.  It matters to me.

Do me a favor and fill out this one question survey to tell me if I should keep doing this digest or not.  Totally anonymously!

Interesting to observe myself consuming more and more content via medium.  What about its design lead to successful win in best content and best contributors?
