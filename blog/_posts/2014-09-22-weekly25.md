###PM Reading Digest - Getting Started
Your weekly product management reading. _The secret of getting ahead is getting started_.

Product Management is NOT same as running a startup.

Still, one of the key pillars of a successful startup is a great product.  Besides, in previous newsletters, we talked about the <a target="_" href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/newsletter/pmfasttrack-2014-09-01/">importance of a building mentality</a> and practice when it comes to modern web/mobile product mnanagement.

Many of you may have seen this, but Y Combinator\'s Sam Altman is teaching a course on startups at Stanford, and the content will be shared online at <a target="_" href="http://startupclass.co/">http://startupclass.co/</a>.  It promises to be a great learning experience, and a good opportunity to gain perspective for those interested in a role at a fast-growth web or mobile startups (who doesn\'t, right?).
<br /><br />

####Call for PM Knowledge

Sam Altman knows a lot, but I am sure some of you know a lot more about product management than he does.

Would any of you care to share your expertise with the wider community?  Perhaps a low-investment 10-15 minutes of lightning lecture, or a simple Q&A session to answer questions about discipline-specific topics?

I would love to hear from you, and to make things simple, built this form - <a target="_" href="https://pmfasttrack.wufoo.com/forms/teaching-via-hangout/">very brief form</a>.  Check it out.

It would be awesome to post regular Google Hangout learning sessions via our <a target="_" href="http://www.meetup.com/ProductLovers/">community meetup page</a> and share your knowledge.
