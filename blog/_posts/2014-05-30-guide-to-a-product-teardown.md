###Intro and Expectations

Recently, the San Francisco [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/ProductManagementFastTrack/) conducted two teardown exercises with the team Yammer. The exercises helped the participants practice and improve product sense, which is a key PM skill.

It is useful to share some of the top-level approaches used in these exercises, which is a way of looking at a product. Your goal is to get into the minds of the product team that built the app. What problem were they solving, and why did they solve it in the particular way the did?

The key takeway should be to improve your product sense, to stay current on product practices, to discover features you may want to build for your app (we are not above stealing).

Prior workshops have included the following comparative teardowns:

* [AirBnb vs Hotel Tonight](http://www.slideshare.net/PMFastTrack/product-teardown-air-bnb-hoteltonight)
* [Carousel vs Flickr](http://www.slideshare.net/PMFastTrack/product-teardown-workshop-carousel-vs-flickr)

###Key Things

These are dimensions or aspects that are commonly used in approaching the product.

* New user experience (onboarding)
* Default user experience
* Sharing/virality
* Engagement features
* Network effect/platform features

Key questions to raise:

* What problem does this product tackle?
* What are the trade-off decisions made by the product team?
* What would you build next?

These are the top contexts that matter.

* What does customer success look like?
* Are we meeting business goals?

Some have rendered the patterns of successful products into a framework. Nir Eyal did this with his book <strong><a target="out" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HJ4A43S/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HJ4A43S&linkCode=as2&tag=pmft-20">Hooked</a></strong> (and not just a book, but a blog and an educational business). Hooked framework applies to the process of building habit-forming products:

1. Trigger
2. Action
3. Variable Reward
4. Commitment (investment)
