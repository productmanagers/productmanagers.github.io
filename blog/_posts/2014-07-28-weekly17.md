###PM Reading Digest - Why Uber is Kicking Ass
Your weekly product management reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

A friend at a legal startup <a target="_" href="http://upcounsel.com/">Upcounsel</a> recently shared an article about growth with me.  I have shared it with others.  It is a post about growth by a Silicon Valley personality, Andrew Chen.

<a target="_" href="http://andrewchen.co/2014/07/08/theres-only-a-few-ways-to-scale-user-growth-and-heres-the-list/">There\'s only a few ways to scale user growth list</a>

Now, here\'s something you should think about as a product manager.  (Check out last week\'s post about coming of age for [product managers](../pmfasttrack-2014-07-21).)

Notice that the list includes what you might think of as "growth hacks."  These ideas involve building or tapping into growth channels.  Where\'s the product management here?

Clearly, Andrew is assuming growth post product development.  But, isn\'t product leadership and innovation another means to massive growth?

Still, the article __clarifies the end game as a product manager__.

Suppose you are running a product team in a startup post product-market validation.  These growth channels roughly outline your product roadmap, and where you might concentrate feature development, and how you prioritize them.

Or suppose you are running a product within a mature corporate team.  You know the growth channels, but you don\'t influence them (for example, sales is run by a separate sales team).

What does product innovation look like for you? PMs, Comment!

####Uber
Speaking of Growth, this is why Uber is winning.  May I present exhibit A.

They are winning, because somebody there is __hustling__.  My mind was _blown_ when I saw that!

It\'s not that the product innovation is getting on Google.  But, makes you think, doesn\'t it?  With partnerships does your product become something else?  (How many ideas and attempts lead to this?  Read [innovation as a numbers game](../pmfasttrack-2014-07-14).)
