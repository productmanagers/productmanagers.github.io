###PM Reading Digest - Jobs and Users

_The secret of getting ahead is getting started_.

I attended Neil McCarthy's (Yammer Product Director) talk on Enterpries Freemium. I found it interesting, especially in uncovering some trends that point to both the convergence and divergence of consumer and enterprise apps.

For example, migration from consumer freemium to enterprise premium (from the deck):

* Gmail/google docs -> Google apps
* Dropbox -> Dropbox for business
* Evernote -> Evernote for business

See slide deck link below.

And those themes from enterprise and consumer web reminded me of Jeff's article about the future of computing: mobile web browser on a tablet.  (Jeff previously founded Stack Overflow.)

>"Apps are great and all, but there has to be some place for this year's bumper crop of obscene amount of computing superpower to go. I like to use history as my guide, and I believe it's going exactly the same place it did on desktops and laptops — that no-installing-anything friend of every lazy user on the planet, the inevitable path of least resistance, the __mobile web browser__."

I know there are lot of good product books out there (many listed in the <a target="_blank" href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/resources/">resources page</a>), but when it comes to leading and just being plain effective, I can think of nothing better than the concise book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC11JW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FC11JW&linkCode=as2&tag=pmft-20&linkId=LSIBMMACBGJGSNO3">The Effective Executive</a> by Peter Drucker.
