The folks at Wakefield are offering us a beautiful discount of 50% (PMFASTTRACK) for the upcoming SF Uncubed at The Regency Center, San Fran.

Among the companies present will be biggest tech product names like __Dropbox__, __Indiegogo__, __Evernote__, __Blackboard__, __Oculus VR__, & __Ticketfly__.

Many of you attended the previous events. What I really like about the Uncubed is that companies actively look for product managers, and not just software engineers.

Check out the link, and save 50% w/ code __PMFASTTRACK__. Register here: [sf.getuncubed.com](http://sf.getuncubed.com)
