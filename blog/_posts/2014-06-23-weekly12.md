###PM Reading Digest
Your weekly <a target="_" href="http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/">product management</a> reading. _Not too much, not too little, just right_.

This week\'s reading is a mix of tools and ideas.  I think this is both a challenge and opportunity in product management - that it is an amalgamation of different disciplines.  Certainly, there are some common and strong themes, among them team leadership, [intelligent process](http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/newsletter/pmfasttrack-2014_04-29_frameworks/) for efficient use of resources, durable [product development process](http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/newsletter/pmfasttrack-2014_06-16/) that can hack away at the market.  However, getting there often means borrowing from a mix of disciplines, while coming up with original solutions to solve a problem.

On a different note, I want to share a few things I learned through the grapevine.  A friend\'s friend turns out to be a dating and confidence guru, and will be leading an <a target="_" href="http://lean-dating.eventbrite.com">Intro to Lean Dating</a> on July 22.  Also, Lewis Lin, the author of <a target="_" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IGIUMQ0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00IGIUMQ0&linkCode=as2&tag=pmft-20&linkId=PFCWTBRYZ7ARH274">Decode and Conquer</a> may be speaking to PMFT community in July.

Another friend and community member started a product-service, sharing job opportunities through stories and pictures.  It\'s kind of awesome.

>"Developing good product intuition—by which I mean developing a good sixth sense about what features or experiences will resonate with people and become successful—is about two core tenets: 1) understanding people’s desires, and 2) understanding how people react to things." <a target="_" href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638">Read more</a>.

Well, I guess the feeling that product management is a little bit of lot of things doesn\'t go away even for the veterans.

>"As builders, we like tools and tech because they’re interesting and new, and we enjoy mastering them. But when you think about the people we’re building for, the reality is usually the opposite. They need simple designs, clear writing, less tech, and fewer abstractions." <a target="_" href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3752-its-ok-not-to-use-tools">Read more</a>.
