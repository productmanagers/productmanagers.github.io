###What Do You Want to Know?

Your weekly product management reading. _The secret of getting ahead is getting started_.

How was your weekend?  Are you ready for a great week and kick ass?

Recently, a reader asked me if there was a good copy of product specs.  It made me wonder what frequently asked questions would be valuable to share with other product managers.

Have you seen Marty Cagan\'s <a target="_" href="http://svpg.com/product-roadmap/">svpg resources page</a>?  Among other things, one can find a <a target="_" href="http://svpg.com/product-roadmap/">sample product roadmap</a>.

Do you have other resources you might like to share?

As you will see below under events, PMFT friends Neil McCarthy (Yammer) and Ryan Glasgow (Weebly) are leading sessions in upcoming weeks - <a target="_" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dont-fear-the-freemium-tickets-13339503815">Enterprise Freemium</a> and <a target="_" href="http://www.meetup.com/ProductManagementFastTrack/events/215127552/">Building the Right Product</a>, respectively.

__Special Opportunities: Catalyst Challenge__

Also, a former friend at Indiegogo, now with presidential fellowship with Dept. of Energy, asked me to share the following opportunity with you.  This applies to innovators and entrepreneurs.

<div class='well'>
<p>The US Department of Energy's SunShot is starting a Catalyst Challenge that offers two-stage prize awards for innovations in solar energy in non-traditional dimensions (e.g., software, API's, Big Data, education, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Awardees retain equity.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The first stage award consists of $25K in software development services from Topcoder.</li>

</ul>

<strong><a target="_" href="https://medium.com/@petershin45/why-do-people-love-startup-school-e168c00694a2">Why Do People Love Startup School</a></strong>, by Peter Shin

Peter wrote this post for the Startup Digest community, but it turns out, it is also a good
list of what makes a great prduct based on those who have made it 'big.'

<div class="well">
<p>If I were to sum up the content of the entire event into a few overarching themes, it would be these three:</p>

<p><strong>AUTHENTICITY:</strong> Great founders don’t “find” a good startup idea by looking for one. Rather, by being intellectual curious, aware of problems around them, and willing to experiment, over time they become the type of person who has good startup ideas “come” to them naturally without really trying.</p>
</div>

Other elements that Peter summarized are Focus on product, Relentlessness, and Energy.
