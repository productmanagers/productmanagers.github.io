###PM Reading List

<h4><a target="out" href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2014/03/multi-device.html">How To Build Habits In A Multi-Device World</a></h4>
__Nir Eyal__

I recently grabbed coffee with a PM Fast Track member and product consultant. I asked him what he is into lately. He said that he is very much interested in optimizing experience across multiple form factors. Nir, who writes about products and ideas that move people, recently wrote about this very topic using his signature framework: Trigger, Action, Reward, Investment.

__Carl Shan__

Carl is a true doer. When he came to the Silicon Valley for an internship, he didn\'t just do the work. He used the time and the opportunity to learn from the best by interviewing them. He compiled his experiences into a FREE 60-page handbook featuring in-depth interviews with product managers at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and more.
