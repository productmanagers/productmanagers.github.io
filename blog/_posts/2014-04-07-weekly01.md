###PM Reading List
<h4><a target="out" href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2014/03/multi-device.html">How To Build Habits In A Multi-Device World</a></h4>
__Nir Eyal__

I recently grabbed coffee with a PM Fast Track member and product consultant. I asked him what he is into lately. He said that he is very much interested in optimizing experience across multiple form factors. Nir, who writes about products and ideas that move people, recently wrote about this very topic using his signature framework: Trigger, Action, Reward, Investment.

<h4><a target="out" href="http://conversionxl.com/5-principles-of-persuasive-web-design/">5 Principles of Persuasive Web Design</a></h4>
__Peep Laja__

"What’s the best way to persuade somebody when talking to them? You have to be confident, talk fast and swear a little, among other things. But what about persuading somebody without words.  Possible?"

<h4><a target="out" href="https://www.kennethnorton.com/essays/how-to-work-with-software-engineers.html">How to Work with Software Engineers</a></h4>
__Ken Norton__

"For years I’ve kept my secrets close to the vest. But no longer: today I will share with you my Ten-Step Plan for Working With Engineers. Or more to the point: how to make engineers do what you tell them to do." (I hope you have a sense of humor!)

<h4><a target="out" href="http://thepmhandbook.com/">The Product Manager Handbook</a></h4>
__Carl Shan__

Carl is a true doer. When he came to the Silicon Valley for an internship, he didn\'t just do the work. He used the time and the opportunity to learn from the best by interviewing them. He compiled his experiences into a FREE 60-page handbook featuring in-depth interviews with product managers at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and more.
